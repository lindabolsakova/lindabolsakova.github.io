headline: The work is often sculptural, but it is a sculpture that is attuned to the changing nature of things; sculpture that is, in this sense, always a performance.
quote: Linda turns her body into a conduit for expressing the meaning of natural processes, seeking the symbiosis of these biological units, a symbiosis based on equality and reciprocity. This is evidently a perspective influenced by the idea of ecofeminism, but devoid of didactic messages – in a sensory manner, the proximity of a woman’s body and nature is embodied by fragility, which is transformed into an installation of slow confluence.

My practice explores human relationship with the environment and draws parallels between human embodiment and other material embodiments, especially those of plants. It aims to expose these connections and participate in developing a stronger sense of belonging to ecosystems and to the larger community of beings that mutually inhabit our planet. It also hopes to encourage envisioning different ways of relating to the other by creating a space for empathic encounters and a culture of sustainability. I often explore how various cultural and historic events influence the lives of plants and how universal events shape our human lives. In line with object oriented ontology, new materialism, ecofeminism and process thought I acknowledge the vibrancy and equality of materials and other beings.
