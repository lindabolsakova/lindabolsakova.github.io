This research-based performative experience asks questions about the memory of a place and about memory's place in culture, as well as individually in each of us. What does it mean to remember that, which has been submerged in the past? How important is physical pace in the preservation of a memory? Can our memories, like plant species, disappear altogether if they lose their habitat?</description></item><item><title>Info</title><link>https://lindabolsakova.github.io/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lindabolsakova.github.io/about/</guid><description>My practice explores human relationship with the environment and draws parallels between human embodiment and other material embodiments, especially those of plants. It aims to expose these connections and participate in developing a stronger sense of belonging to ecosystems and to the larger community of beings that mutually inhabit our planet. It also hopes to encourage envisioning different ways of relating to the other by creating a space for empathic encounters and a culture of sustainability.</description></item></channel></rss>
